# MySQL

MySQL is an opensource sequel database to store data inside a structured table. 

```
 Where to chose sequest or no-sequel database depends on the type of data, application and the useCase. It's purely developer driven.
 Version of the MySQL to be installed is also an input from the developer.
```

#### Install MySQL Server  ( Version 8.0.x : As per Developer's choice )

```
    # dnf install mysql-server -y

```

#### Restart Nginx Service to load the changes of the configuration.

```
    # systemctl enable mysqld 
    # systemctl start  mysqld           
```

#### Next, We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service. Use password ExpenseApp@1 or any other as per your choice.

```
    # mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1

```

!!!! It's always recommended to configure and set up your Database before your application comes up. If not application looks for the Database and app will fail.
